Installation
------------
Download the precompiled kernel or an SD card image and instructions from our website:
https://www.alliedvision.com/en/products/software/embedded-software-and-drivers.html

Alternatively, use the sources of our kernel driver module.
To install the sources, use the links listed above and follow these steps:

On your Linux PC
    1. Go to our GitHub repository and download the kernel driver module sources and our setup, build, and deploy scripts.
    2. Run setup.sh, which installs tools for building the kernel and preparing the environment.
    3. Run build.sh, which builds the Linux kernel including our driver.
       We have tested this script with Ubuntu 16.04 and Ubuntu 18.04. The script creates several files.
    4. Run deploy.sh, which collects these files and puts them into AlliedVision*.tar.gz, which is the deliverable.
       
On your ARM board
    1. Install the supported operating system of the ARM board provided by the board manufacturer. 
       Follow the instructions of the board manufacturer. 
    2. Copy the AlliedVision*.tar.gz archive to the SD card of your ARM board.
    3. Unpack the AlliedVision*tar.gz file, which contains install.sh.
    4. Run install.sh and follow its instructions.
