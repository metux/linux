	  Say Y here to get to see options for board support that's initialized
	  via compiled-in flattened device trees.

	  This is entirely independent from traditional DT-based booting (or DT
	  overlays) and meant for additional devices on non-OF-based (eg. APCI)
	  boards or composite devices behind probing-capable busses (eg. PCI).

	  Instead of writing individual drivers for just the initialization of
	  subdevices, this option provides a generic mechanism for describing
	  these devices via device tree.

	  If you say N, all options in this submenu will be skipped and disabled.
